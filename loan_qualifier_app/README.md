# Loan Qualifier Application

This application will automate the calculations used to determine the qualifications of a loan applicant. The output is determined by both user inputted data, in the CLI, and bank data, located in a CSV document. The hope is to streamline the loan application process and create a smoother procedure for both the customer and business.
